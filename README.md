This project,using the “UrbanSounds8K” dataset, the sounds heard in the cities
I will do a project on classification.
I will prepare a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model by preprocessing these images and
I will train the model.  

Exploring the dataset has two parts:

Importing datasets (train and test csv's)
Reshaping the images
CNN Model
Creating Sequential Model
5 Convolution
5 Pooling
Relu as Activation Function

Result
0.8546 Validation Accuracy
