This project,using the “UrbanSounds8K” dataset, the sounds heard in the cities

I will do a project on classification.I will prepare a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model by preprocessing these images andI will train the model.  

#### Exploring the dataset has two parts:

#### 1. Pre-Processing Data

a. By reading the images (spectrograms) in order, grayscale transformation, resizing
and normalize.

b. Save images with their tags in [image, tag] format.
add to the list.

c. Using this list, you can create the X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, X_test and y_test  datasets.


D. Save these datasets to your computer.

#### 2. Training Model Using CNN

a. Prepare a CNN model.

b. Train the model using the data you have prepared.

c. Print the model's performance metrics, loss and accuracy graphs on the screen.

D. Do hyperparameter optimization based on the results you get.

#### Result
0.8546 Validation Accuracy
